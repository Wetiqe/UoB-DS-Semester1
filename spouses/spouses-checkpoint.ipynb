There\n> appears to have been no truth in these suggestions. It is no doubt true that\n> the proportion of third class passengers saved falls far short of the\n> proportion of the first and second class, but this is accounted for by the\n> greater reluctance of the third class passengers to leave the ship, by their\n> unwillingness to part with their baggage, by the difficulty in getting them\n> up from their quarters, which were at the extreme ends of the ship, and by\n> other similar causes.",
